# lootbox-roller

a tool used for rolling lootbox style loot for D20 Modern/ D&amp;D 3.5

## KnownIssues:

when rolling for an uncommon or specific weapon with a special ability, if a ranged weapon is rolled, a melee ability is given -- (possibly could just roll for both and let the user choose the correct one.)
